best split of disession tree 
gini = 1 - ginni
chi suqare 
statatistic significance difference between child node and parent node 
sum of squared standerdised difference between actual-excepted ^2/excepted
higher the chisquared score higher the purity of the node higher the homogenisity 

information gain 
1-entropy

entropy 
p*log1p1+p- log2p2+....plogk 
p is the percentage (e.g who play cricket)

less entropy pure node 
higher entropy less pure node higher the homoginicity 
higher information gain higher the purity of the node higher the homogenisity (1-entropy)
