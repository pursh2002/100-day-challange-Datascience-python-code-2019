logit  model
used in dicotomous or binary , pas or fsil, sucess or failure 
why cannot we use multiple regression ?
errors will be non-normal
errors will no more be homoscedastic
resulting baised estimate, invalid standerd error,hypothessis test , cannot interpret t significance 
the b slop and intercept cannot be explained with full confidence 

modelling 
probaility of surviving after an heart attack
probability of customer default the loan 
probability fo student passing the exam

model 
is the log P/1-p probabil of event occuring / prob of event not occuring = a+bx linear combination of independent variable 

independent variale can be any continous/catogorical/nominal/binary

when we take log on the right hand side it becomes exponential of linear equation 
 p/1-p = e^a+bx 
 
 P = e^a+bx/ 1- e^a+bx 
 
 objective is to find the value of P
 can plot logistic curve 
 
 y = prob of event occuring range from 0 to 1
 x = independent value whic can range from + to - infinity
 
 estimation is done through max likelihood method
 chisquared in place of t 
 model fit is through concordance and KS statistics, no r square pseodo r square(not imortant)
 
 
 if there is more then two outcome 
 multinomial logistic regression for nominal
 ordered logistic for ordered data
