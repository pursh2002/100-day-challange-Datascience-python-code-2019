e.g how rainfall affect the yield 
how does income changes as u age 

per capita and life expecancy logarithim of percapita gdp the data does not fit the model
but the liner transformation does the work 
the mean of the the life expectancy| logarithim of per capta gdp approximat a straight line 

some of teh data does not fit properly 

liner regression cannot interpret beta cofficient r^2 is not great t test is non significant 

no straight line fit the model 

simple variation in liner regression 
add power to the x variable 

y = bx+b^2+X^3...

transformation can be tried 
x^2, x^3
log x
log x^2

mean squared error is minimum that model should be final that should be used for prediction equilent to choosing higher r^@

with regards to comparing polynomial regression radj^2
