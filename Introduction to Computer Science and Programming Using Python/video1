diff calsses of algorithims

what does computer do ?
calcualtion (billion calcualtion per second )
100 gigabits of storage 1.5 million books

Type of Knowledge 
Delerative & Imperative 
deledative - true knowledge , statment of fact 
Imperative - a recipe , 'how to '
face the student 
go three steps down 

So imperative knowledge is importent 

what is A recipe 
steps in sqquence (check list)
flow of control 
when to stop

steps 1+2+3 = algorithims 


How do we capture recipe 

Fixed program
computer 
calculator 
turing 

stored programed computer 
computer 
machine store and executes instruction 

Basic machine architurture 

memory --- data or sequence of insturuction program 

control unit(program counter) load the program in machine location of instruction in memory  <-----> ALU - Arithmetic logic unit (do premitive opr)(store stuff in memory)

once we have the recipe programing language - the set of primetive operation
next step is hwo do we put tham to gether - to do that we use expression(legal combinition of primitives in porgramng language )
expressiona dn compution have value which have soome meaning 

aspects 
language : eniglosh 
programing language - numbers , strings , simple operators (addition,sub,div)
SYNTAX - BOY DO CAT , THIS NOT VALID 
boy has cat , valid
programing - hi*5 , not valid 
5*4 = valid 

sementic - 

where things can go wrong
 synaptic error 
static semantic error 
no sementic error but different programing meaning then we intended
