The data set is a CSV file called World_Happiness_2015.csv. Below are descriptions for some of the columns we'll be working with:

Country - Name of the country.
Region - Name of the region the country belongs to.
Happiness Rank - The rank of the country, as determined by its happiness score.
Happiness Score - A score assigned to each country based on the answers to a poll question that asks respondents to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10.
Family - The estimated extent to which family contributes to the happiness score.
Freedom - The estimated extent to which freedom contributes to the happiness score.
Generosity - The estimated extent to which generosity contributes to the happiness score.

1. Use the pd.read_csv() function to read the World_Happiness_2015.csv file into a dataframe called happiness2015.
Store the first five rows of the dataframe in a variable called first_5.
Use the DataFrame.info() method to print information about the dataframe.
After you have run your code, use the variable inspector to look at the variable first_5 and the output to get
familiar with the data.

happiness2015 = pd.read_csv("World_Happiness_2015.csv")
first_5 = happiness2015.head(5)
happiness2015.info()

2. First, let's visualize the happiness score of each country in happiness2015:
happiness2015['Happiness Score'].plot(kind='bar', title='Happiness Scores', ylim=(0,10))
happiness2015['Region'].unique()

"array(['Western Europe', 'North America', 'Australia and New Zealand',
       'Middle East and Northern Africa', 'Latin America and Caribbean',
       'Southeastern Asia', 'Central and Eastern Europe', 'Eastern Asia',
       'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Southern Asia'], dtype=object)"
       
       
 Let's try plotting just one region next:
 
so_asia = happiness2015[happiness2015['Region'] == 'Southern Asia']
so_asia.plot(x='Country', y='Happiness Score', kind='barh', title='Southern Asia Happiness Scores', xlim=(0,10))

It's much easier to read this visualization - we can clearly see the labels and values. However, 
we wouldn't know if the Southern Asia region is representative of the entire world unless we look at the other regions. 
What we really want is to create a visualization that uses one number, a summary statistic like the mean, to summarize
the data for each region.
In this mission, we'll learn how to perform different kinds of aggregations, applying a statistical operation to groups 
of our data, and create visualizations like the one above.
