List methods

Let's practice list methods!

Let's imagine a situation: you went to the market and filled your baskets (basket1 and basket2) with fruits. You wanted to have one of each kind but realized that some fruits were put in both baskets.

Task 1. Your first task is to remove everything from basket2 that is already present in basket1.

Task 2. After the removal it is reasonable to anticipate that one of the baskets might weight more compared to the another (all fruit kinds weight the same). Therefore, the second task is to transfer some fruits from a heavier basket to the lighter one to get approximately the same weight/amount of fruits.

Instructions 1/2

Remove fruits from basket2 that are already present in basket1.

for item in basket1:
    if item in basket2:
        basket2.remove(item)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))

Task 1. Your first task is to remove everything from basket2 that is already present in basket1.

basket to the lighter one to get approximately the same weight/amount of fruits.

Transfer fruits from basket1 to basket2 until the amount in basket2 becomes more or equal to the amount in basket1.

for item in basket1:
    if item in basket2:
        basket2.remove(item)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))

# Transfer fruits from basket1 to basket2
while len(basket1) > len(basket2):
    item_to_transfer = basket1.pop()
    basket2.append(item_to_transfer)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))

Operations on sets

Putting the information on sets in more mathematical terms, we can define the following operations given two sets X and Y:

  X∩Y - the intersection between X and Y (all elements which are in both X and Y)

  X∪Y - the union between X and Y (all elements which are either in X or Y)

  X−Y - the difference between X and Y (all elements which are in X but not in Y)

You are given 5 sets of integers A, B, C, D,E. What is the result of the following expression?
(A∪(B∩C))−(D∩E)

4.
Storing data in a dictionary
The surface you see below is called circular paraboloid:

Circular Paraboloid

It can be described by the following equation:
x2a2+y2a2=z
Let's set the coefficient a to 1. Therefore, the radius at each cut will be equal to z√.

Your task is to create a dictionary that stores the mapping from the pair of coordinates (x,y) 
to the z coordinate (the lists storing considered ranges for x and y are given: range_x and range_y, respectively).

Calculate the value for z coordinate using coordinates x and y.
Create a new key for the dictionary circ_parab represented as a tuple containing x and y.
Create a new key-value pair for circ_parab.

circ_parab = dict()

for x in range_x:
    for y in range_y:       
        # Calculate the value for z
        z = x**2 + y**2
        # Create a new key for the dictionary
        key = (x, y)
        # Create a new key-value pair      
        circ_parab[(x, y)] = z
5. 
String indexing and concatenation
You are presented with one of the earliest known encryption techniques - Caesar cipher. 
It is based on a simple shift of each letter in a message by a certain number of positions down the given alphabet. 
For example, given the English alphabet, a shift of 1 for 'xyz' would imply 'yza' and vice versa in case of decryption. 
Notice that 'z' becomes 'a' in this case.
Thus, encryption/decryption requires two arguments: text and an integer key denoting the shift (key = 1 
for the example above).

Your task is to create an encryption function given the English alphabet stored in the alphabet string.

Fill in the blanks in the loop to create an encrypted text.
Check the encryption function with the shift equals to 10 (it should return 'nkdkmkwz').

def encrypt(text, key):
  
    result = ''

    # Fill in the blanks to create an encrypted text
    for char in text.lower():
        idx = (alphabet.index(char) + key) % len(alphabet)
        result = result + alphabet[idx]

    return result

# Check the encryption function with the shift equals to 10
print(encrypt("datacamp", 10))

Great! Interestingly, decryption function is only different by the line you fixed in the for loop. 
What would be the corresponding change in the decrypt() function?

def encrypt(text, key):
  
    result = ''

    # Fill in the blanks to create an encrypted text
    for char in text.lower():
        idx = alphabet.index(char) - key
        result = result + alphabet[idx]

    return result

# Check the encryption function with the shift equals to 10
print(encrypt("datacamp", 10))

6. 
Operations on strings
You are given the variable text storing the following string 'StRing ObJeCts haVe mANy inTEResting pROPerTies'.

Your task is to modify this string in such a way that would result in 'string OBJECTS have MANY interesting 
PROPERTIES' (every other word in text is uppercased and lowercased, otherwise). 

First, create a word list from the given string.
# Create a word list from the string stored in 'text'
Now, make every other word uppercased and lowercased, otherwise.

word_list = text.split()

# Make every other word uppercased; otherwise - lowercased
for i in range(len(word_list)):
    if (i + 1) % 2 == 0:
        word_list[i] = word_list[i].upper()
    else:
        word_list[i] = word_list[i].lower()
        
# Join the words back and form a new string
new_text = ' '.join(word_list)
print(new_text)
You will obtain this result in three steps.

Fixing string errors in a DataFrame
You are given the heroes dataset containing the information on different comic book heroes. 
However, you'll need to make some refinements in order to use this dataset further.

Comparing Eye color, Hair color, and Skin color columns, you can see that strings in the Hair color 
columns are capitalized, whereas in other two the strings are lowercased.

Moreover, some rows in the Gender column contain a spelling error (Fmale instead of Female).

Your task is to make the strings in the Hair column lowercased and to fix the spelling error in the Gender column.
Substitute all the appearances of Fmale with Female in the Gender column.

# Make all the values in the 'Hair color' column lowercased
heroes['Hair color'] = heroes['Hair color'].str.lower()
  
# Check the values in the 'Hair color' column
print(heroes['Hair color'].value_counts())

# Substitute 'Fmale' with 'Female' in the 'Gender' column
heroes['Gender'] = heroes['Gender'].str.replace('Fmale', 'Female')

# Check if there is no occurences of 'Fmale'
print(heroes['Gender'].value_counts())

   Write a regular expression
Let's write some regular expressions!

Your task is to create a regular expression matching a 
valid temperature represented either in Celsius or Fahrenheit scale (e.g. '+23.5 C', '-4 F', '0.0 C') 
and to extract all the appearances from the given string text. Positive temperatures can be prefixed with + or 
contain no prefix (e.g. '5 F', '+5 F'). Negative temperatures must be prefixed with -. Zero temperature should not 
be prefixed with any symbol.

The re module is already imported.

Tip: the + symbol within the square brackets [] corresponds to the symbol itself (e.g. the regular 

expression [1a+] matches to '1', 'a', or '+').
Define the pattern to search for valid temperatures
Create an object storing the matches using finditer().
Loop over matches_storage and print out item properties: the matching sequence, its start and end index.

# Define the pattern to search for valid temperatures
pattern = re.compile(r'[+-]?\d+\.?\d* [CF]')

# Print the temperatures out
print(re.findall(pattern, text))

# Create an object storing the matches using 'finditer()'
matches_storage = re.finditer(pattern, text)

# Loop over matches_storage and print out item properties
for match in matches_storage:
    print('matching sequence = ' + match.group())
    print('start index = ' + str(match.start()))
    print('end index = ' + str(match.end()))
2.

Find the incorrect pattern
Which of the following regular expressions will precisely match the long date format 
(for example, October 26, 1988 or Oct 26, 1988 with the first letter capitalized)?

Consider only the non-negative years.

The module re is already imported.

Possible Answers
\w+\s[1-3]?\d,\s\d+
[A-Z][a-z]+\s\d{1,2},\s\d+
ANswer [A-Z][a-z]+\s[1-3]?\d,\s\d+
[A-Z][a-z]+\s[1-3]?\d,\s\d*

Splitting by a pattern
You are given a text stored in the text variable.

Split the text in such a way that the resulting list has only words or numbers with no blank spaces or punctuation.

Compile the regular expression.
Split the text so that only words or numbers are included in the resulting list, and print the result.

# Compile the regular expression
pattern = re.compile(r'[,:\.]?\s?')

# Split the text that only words or numbers are left
words = re.split(pattern, text)
print(words)

# Define an easier way to extract words or numbers
alt_pattern = re.compile(r'\w+')
print(re.findall(alt_pattern, text))
