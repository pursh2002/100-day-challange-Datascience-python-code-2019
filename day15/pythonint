List methods

Let's practice list methods!

Let's imagine a situation: you went to the market and filled your baskets (basket1 and basket2) with fruits. You wanted to have one of each kind but realized that some fruits were put in both baskets.

Task 1. Your first task is to remove everything from basket2 that is already present in basket1.

Task 2. After the removal it is reasonable to anticipate that one of the baskets might weight more compared to the another (all fruit kinds weight the same). Therefore, the second task is to transfer some fruits from a heavier basket to the lighter one to get approximately the same weight/amount of fruits.

Instructions 1/2

Remove fruits from basket2 that are already present in basket1.

for item in basket1:
    if item in basket2:
        basket2.remove(item)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))

Task 1. Your first task is to remove everything from basket2 that is already present in basket1.

to the another (all fruit kinds weight the same). Therefore, the second task is to transfer some fruits from a heavier 
basket to the lighter one to get approximately the same weight/amount of fruits.

Transfer fruits from basket1 to basket2 until the amount in basket2 becomes more or equal to the amount in basket1.

for item in basket1:
    if item in basket2:
        basket2.remove(item)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))

# Transfer fruits from basket1 to basket2
while len(basket1) > len(basket2):
    item_to_transfer = basket1.pop()
    basket2.append(item_to_transfer)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))

Operations on sets

Putting the information on sets in more mathematical terms, we can define the following operations given two sets X and Y:

  X∩Y - the intersection between X and Y (all elements which are in both X and Y)

  X∪Y - the union between X and Y (all elements which are either in X or Y)

  X−Y - the difference between X and Y (all elements which are in X but not in Y)

You are given 5 sets of integers A, B, C, D,E. What is the result of the following expression?
(A∪(B∩C))−(D∩E)
