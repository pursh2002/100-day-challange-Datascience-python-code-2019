Whats is algorithmic thinking ?
Algorithmic thinking is a way of getting to a solution through the clear definition of the steps needed 
For example, we all learn algorithms for doing multiplication at school. If we (or a computer) follow the rules we were 
taught precisely we can get the answer to any multiplication problem. Once we have the algorithm 
we donâ€™t have to work out how to do multiplication from scratch every time we are faced with a new problem.

The power of algorithmic thinking is that it allows solutions to be automated.

Input and output e.g graph of input 1, 2, 3, 4 people in network 

Understanding the problem is the first. Formulating the problem is the second. Developing an algorithm is the third. 
Implementing the algorithm is the fourth. And then the fifth one is running it on the data and answering the 
original question.
 
 motivates the use of discrete math and algorithms in computer science
