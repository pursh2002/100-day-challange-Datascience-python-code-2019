#49: Probability Mass Function(PMF) & Probability Density Function (PDF)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The probability that a discrete random variable X takes on a particular value x, i.e., P(X = x), 
denoted as f(x), is called the probability mass function. This function gives the probability that a 
discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It is often the primary means of defining a 
discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random 
variables whose domain is discrete.

The probability that a continuous random variable X takes on a range (a,b), i.e., f(a,b)=P(a<X<b) is 
called the probability density function. It is a statistical expression that defines a probability 
distribution for a continuous random variable. When the PDF is graphically portrayed, the area under 
the curve will indicate the interval in which the variable will fall. The total area in this interval 
of the graph equals the probability of a continuous random variable occurring. 

E.g. the probability that today's temperature will be 80 degrees (80 degrees exactly) is measured by 
PMF and the probability that the temperature will be between 80 and 85 degrees is measured by PDF.
