#49: Probability Mass Function(PMF) & Probability Density Function (PDF)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The probability that a discrete random variable X takes on a particular value x, i.e., P(X = x), 
denoted as f(x), is called the probability mass function. This function gives the probability that a 
discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It is often the primary means of defining a 
discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random 
variables whose domain is discrete.

The probability that a continuous random variable X takes on a range (a,b), i.e., f(a,b)=P(a<X<b) is 
called the probability density function. It is a statistical expression that defines a probability 
distribution for a continuous random variable. When the PDF is graphically portrayed, the area under 
the curve will indicate the interval in which the variable will fall. The total area in this interval 
of the graph equals the probability of a continuous random variable occurring. 

E.g. the probability that today's temperature will be 80 degrees (80 degrees exactly) is measured by 
PMF and the probability that the temperature will be between 80 and 85 degrees is measured by PDF.

#50: Sampling with replacement and without replacement
-----------------------
Sampling 'with replacement' means that when a unit selected at random from the population, it is returned to the 
population (replaced), and then a second element is selected at random. Here, the two sample values are independent 
i.e. what we get on the first one doesn't affect what we get on the second. The covariance between the two is zero.
Sampling 'without replacement' means when a unit selected at random from the population, it is not returned to the 
population (replaced), and then a second element is selected at random. Each sample unit of the population has only 
one chance to be selected in the sample. Here, the two sample values aren't independent i.e. what we got on the for 
the first one affects what we can get for the second one. The covariance between the two isn't zero. Here, the covariance 
depends on the population size. If the population is very large, this covariance is very close to zero. In that case, 
sampling with replacement isn't much different from sampling without replacement. sometimes, this difference is described 
as 
sampling from an infinite population (sampling with replacement) vs sampling from a finite population (without replacement).
