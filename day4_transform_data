1. You may recall from previous missions that each of the columns below contains the estimated extent to 
which each factor contributes to the happiness score:

Economy (GDP per Capita)
Family
Health (Life Expectancy)
Freedom
Trust (Government Corruption)
Generosity
Throughout this mission, we'll refer to the columns above as the "factor" columns. We'll work to answer the following question 
in this mission:

Which of the factors above contribute the most to the happiness score?

However, in order to answer this question, we need to manipulate our data into a format that makes it easier to analyze. 
We'll explore the following functions and methods to perform this task:

Series.map()
Series.apply()
DataFrame.applymap()
DataFrame.apply()
pd.melt()
