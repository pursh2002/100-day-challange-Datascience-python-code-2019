We introduced some of these methods already in the Pandas Fundamentals course when we 
learned the following data cleaning tasks:

Cleaning column names
Extracting values from the start of strings
Extracting values from the end of strings
In this mission, we'll learn a couple other string cleaning tasks such as:

Finding specific strings or substrings in columns
Extracting substrings from unstructured data
Removing strings or substrings from a series

We'll work with the 2015 World Happiness Report again and additional economic data from the World Bank.

Below are descriptions for the columns we'll be working with:

ShortName - Name of the country
Region - The region the country belongs to
IncomeGroup - The income group the country belongs to, based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
CurrencyUnit - Name of country's currency
SourceOfMostRecentIncomeAndExpenditureData - The name of the survey used to collect the income and expenditure data
SpecialNotes - Contains any miscellaneous notes about the data

1. 
We've already read World_Happiness_2015.csv into a dataframe called happiness2015 and World_dev.csv into a 
dataframe called world_dev.
Use the pd.merge() function to combine happiness2015 and world_dev. Save the resulting dataframe to merged. 
As a reminder, you can use the following syntax to combine the dataframes: pd.merge(left=df1, right=df2,
how='left', left_on='left_df_Column_Name', right_on='right_df_Column_Name').
Set the left_on parameter to the Country column from happiness2015 and the right_on parameter to the ShortName 
column from world_dev.
Use the DataFrame.rename() method to rename the SourceOfMostRecentIncomeAndExpenditureData column in merged to 
IESurvey (because we don't want to keep typing that long name!).
We've already saved the mapping to a dictionary named col_renaming.
Make sure to set the axis parameter to 1.

world_dev = pd.read_csv("World_dev.csv")
col_renaming = {'SourceOfMostRecentIncomeAndExpenditureData': 'IESurvey'}
merged = pd.merge(left=happiness2015, right= world_dev, how = 'left', left_on = 'Country', right_on = 'ShortName')

merged = merged.rename(col_renaming,axis = 1)

Let's work with the CurrencyUnit column first. Suppose we wanted to extract the unit of currency without the 
leading nationality. For example, instead of "Danish krone" or "Norwegian krone", we just needed "krone".

If we wanted to complete this task for just one of the strings, we could use Python's string.split() method:

words = 'Danish krone'
