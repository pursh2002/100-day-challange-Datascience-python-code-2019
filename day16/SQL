select distinct city from station 
where left(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u') 
and right(city, 1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')

Select DISTINCT CITY from station where city regexp '[aeiou]$' and city in (SELECT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou]');


implified by taking out the nested SELECT and just replacing it with another REGEXP.
So we have for mySQL:
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city RLIKE '^[aeiou]' AND city RLIKE '[aeiou]$'
RLIKE is just a synonym for REGEXP for those who don't know.
Also, simplified even more by (credit: rshaghoulian):
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE city RLIKE '^[aeiou.*aeiou]$'

select distinct(city) from station where city like '[a,e,i,o,u]%' AND city like '%[a,e,i,o,u]';

^			// start of string
[aeiou]			// a single vowel
.			// any characted...
*			// ...repeated any number of times
[aeiou]			// another vowel
$			// end of string


SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE (CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%') 
AND (CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u');


Let  be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let  be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; query the value of  from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
Input Format
The STATION table is described as follows:

SELECT count(city) - count( distinct city) AS N
FROM STATION
